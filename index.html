				<h2>Bank Reconciliations</h2>
				<p>If you can provide a couple months of bank activity in Excel along with the GL showing the bank activity, we can utilize that information to automate the bank rec for you going forward. We'll also provide recommendations on how to simplify the process and make it easier and more accurate. Estimated $1,000.</p>

			<article>
				<h2>Monthly Tax Reconciiliations</h2>
				<p>With a copy of your trial balance report, P&L, and tax filing calculations from the prior couple months, we can review & provide an automated tool to match your process. We will not be auditing the accuracy of the tax reconciliation just providing a tool based on what is provided. Estimated $1,000.</p>

            		<article>
				<h2>Daily Tax Reconciliations</h2>
				<p>If you choose to allow us to build out your Monthly Tax Reconciliations & Income Journal, we can also provide a file that confirms the taxes on a daily basis utilizing the same information & providing variances that should be researched & corrected or offset with tax exemption documentation. Estimated $250.</p>

				<h2>Income Journal</h2>
				<p>With the excel versions of all the PMS/POS/Other reports utilized to create the Income Journal and a few completed Income Journals we will build tools that automatically compile the data for you, the only thing we can't do is automate the Miscellaneous posts.
